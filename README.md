# Aman Singh – Portfolio

👋 Hey there! I'm **Aman Singh**, a passionate student and aspiring software engineer. This is the source code for my personal portfolio, where I showcase my projects, skills, achievements, and more.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with strong expertise in both frontend and backend development. I love contributing to open-source projects, exploring cloud technologies, and building user-centric applications with intuitive UI/UX.

### Fun Fact 
When I'm not roasting bugs in my code, I'm either vibing to music like it's my full-time job or channeling my inner Thomas Shelby—calm, calculated, and a little dramatic with every debug. 💻🎧🔥
